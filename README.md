### Business Problem
As a result of the increasing adoption of Electric Vehicles, PowerCharge Utilities has continued to experience several critical challenges including; 
A. Increased Load Demand caused by the Widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles especially during peak charging periods has significantly strained the existing distribution network infrastructure.

B. Reduction in grid reliability due to frequent overload in the distribution network leading to consistent voltage fluctuations and power outages in specific areas.

C. Meeting customers' expectations regarding reliable and convenient charging service, especially for EV Owners is becoming increasingly difficult.

D. Balancing increased load demands and grid reliability comes at a significant cost. PowerCharge Utilities must optimize network investments to manage expenses effectively.
